Play games with the smart phone as remote, and pc as the screen

A small prototype of using a smart phone as the remote control, and the browser as the screen to display the game.

Very early stage, but a very fun idea and concept.

The "big picture" was to make a tool for game developers to use this concept.
The game developer would just have to write code for the remote, and the game, and not have to worry about the connection between the two.
